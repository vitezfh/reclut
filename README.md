# reclut

Recult is a set of tools for reddit; it can presently be used for downloading of media from subreddits, users, etc.
It can also fully utilize a bandwidth's potential while it downloads concurrently (can be adjusted to one's own need). The easy, built in archiver helps not to repeat downloads.

I develop this sporadically; and for my own purposes, meaning that breakage and interface changes are expected.
