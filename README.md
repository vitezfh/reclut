# reclut

Recult is a set of tools for reddit; it can presently be used to download media (jpg,gif,webm,etc.) from subreddits and users.
It can also fully utilize a bandwidth's potential while it downloads concurrently. The easy, built in archiver helps not to repeat downloads.

The config should be initialized upon installation to your default config folder. This is usually .config/reclut/config

This tool depends heavily on PRAW, so for configuration have a look at https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html

I develop this sporadically; and for my own purposes, meaning that breakage and interface changes are expected. I'll write up a quick-start guide sometime.
